    "# Payback period of electric heat pumps\n",
    "\n",
    "Hydronic heating works by providing heat energy to the home in the form of hot water, which is radiated inside the house. We can heat the water either by using a gas boiler, or an air-to-water heat pump. The gas boilers have a coefficient of performance (COP) of approximately 0.7, which means that 70% of the gas energy put in makes it as heat into the water (and thus the house). The Stiebel Eltron AC25 heat pump has a COP of 5, which means that for every watt of electricity put in, you get 5 watts of heat out (!). This is achieved by harvesting ambient heat from the air (and produces colder air outside as a by-product).\n",
    "\n",
    "The issue is that heat pumps are more expensive than gas boilers. In this case, we will assume a 3K AUD gas boiler faced against a 15K AUD heat pump.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use the [pint](https://pint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) library to convert units and figure out how many years of heating we need to make back the cost of the heat pump."
